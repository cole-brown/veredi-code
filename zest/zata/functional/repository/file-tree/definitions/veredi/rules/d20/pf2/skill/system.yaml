# Define all known skills. The only thing that allows users outside these bounds
# are these lines in the grouped skills:
#    !meta user.defined: allow
#
# For those groups, users can set the sub-type themselves. e.g.
#   - Profession: Soldier
#   - Perform: Vocal
#
# Note that the 'knowledge' group does not have that option so it is set in
# stone.
