      - InputSystem can also be seen as Invoker, sort of, since it decideds
        what is a command to be sent here for further processing before
        execution.

    Systems can register commands they want.

    The Commander can then receive input from its owner, InputSystem,
    process it, and invoke the registered receiver.

    The registered receiver /should/ be a function that does minimal processing
    and returns a created event to be sent to EventManager. This way other
    systems are not stealing time from InputSystem/Commander, and do the bulk
