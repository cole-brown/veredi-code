    Role/Attribute-based Access Control via these Permission Flags.

    Users are authenticated and receive a number of Authorization flags for

    When the user attempts to execute a command, their authorization is checked
    against the command's permissions before allowing.

    It is, for example, only allowing attack commands from things with
    HealthComponents. They don't need health to attack, probably, but maybe you
    want to restrict attacking to entities who can receive damage in return.
